  <h1>Regulatory Status & Governance</h1>

  <h2>Project status</h2>
  <p>
    SimHealth is an early-stage digital health research project in pre-pilot development.
    It is not a medical device, clinical service, or emergency intervention.
  </p>

  <h2>Intended purpose</h2>
  <p>
    SimHealth explores whether clinician-guided, safety-first digital tools could support
    people experiencing gambling-related harm between clinical contacts, under professional oversight.
  </p>

  <h2>What SimHealth is not</h2>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>Not medical advice or diagnosis</li>
    <li>Not emergency or crisis care</li>
    <li>Not automated clinical decision-making</li>
    <li>Not a replacement for professional judgment</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Regulatory positioning</h2>
  <p>
    SimHealth is not currently classified as a medical device.
    If future development introduces regulated functionality,
    appropriate regulatory pathways will be assessed before deployment.
  </p>

  <h2>Clinical governance</h2>
  <p>
    Any future patient-facing use would occur only within supervised,
    ethically approved contexts with appropriate clinical oversight.
  </p>

  <h2>Research & ethics</h2>
  <p>
    Professional feedback activities are consent-led, non-clinical,
    and do not involve patient-identifying information.
  </p>

  <h2>Data protection & privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Data handling follows GDPR principles, privacy-by-design,
    and data minimisation practices.
  </p>

  <h2>Jurisdiction</h2>
  <p>
    SimHealth is currently anchored in the European Union (France).
  </p>

  <h2>Transparency</h2>
  <p>
    This page will be updated as the project evolves.
    No claims of clinical effectiveness are made at this stage.
